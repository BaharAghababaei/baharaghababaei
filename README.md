# 👋 Hi, I'm Bahareh Aghababaei!

## 🎯 About Me
Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a data scientist who loves turning complex problems into practical, data-driven solutions. I hold two MSc degrees — one in Business Administration (Operations & Logistics) from UBC Sauder School of Business and another in Industrial Engineering from Iran University of Science & Technology. 
My main interest lies in applying advanced analytics — including optimization, machine learning, and statistical modeling — to solve real-world challenges in areas like transportation, healthcare, and retail.


## 🔎 What I Do
- **Predictive and prescriptive analytics**
- **Large-scale optimization & mathematical modeling**
- **Machine learning and deep learning (PyTorch, Scikit-learn)**
- **Data Analysis using statistical modeling**
